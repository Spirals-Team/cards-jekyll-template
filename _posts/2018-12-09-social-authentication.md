# Context

This research internship is part of the Momentum project "_Managing your data without leakage of information_" funded by the CNRS and coordinated by Pierre Bourhis. This project aims to strengthen the privacy of users on the Internet by identifying potential leaks of private information and proposing effective countermeasures to better control the nature of personal data that can be accessed by unauthorized third parties . This project therefore addresses a societal issue for the entire population.

Many web applicationsâ€”including specialized social networks-now offer users the ability to authenticate using their Facebook (or Google or other) account and import some data to feed a user profile, for example. However, these data may be indirectly exposed by weaker web sites and thus help to create implicit links between different profiles of the same person, thus revealing potentially intimate information.

# Objective

At a local level, we propose a logical approach to modeling social network data and potential links between them.

On a global scale, we propose to identify the data access control strategies according to a user's profile (external, authenticated, etc.).
